# Wellido 
Wellido is meant to answer the age old question: "What do you want for dinner?" In order to accomplish this goal I designed this app using a combination of API calls to retrieve location data from an ip address (IPData) and then present a user with options based on what keywords they put in and what radius around them they wanted to search. The pictures, addresses, and location data were all called using Google's Place API. While this is just an example of the code the screenshots of the project can be found on my LinkedIn profile.  https://www.linkedin.com/in/baines-deal/
